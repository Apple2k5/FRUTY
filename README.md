FRUTY: Smart Farming Revolution

"Turning every farmer's field into a smart farm assistant."

FRUTY is an autonomous, intelligent agricultural robot system designed to automate critical farm tasks, maximize crop yield, and reduce resource waste using real-time data analysis.

üåü Features

FRUTY tackles key challenges in small-scale farming through four integrated modules:

Pest & Weed Detection: Uses a 3D Camera and the YOLOv5 AI model running on a Raspberry Pi for real-time identification of pests and weed overgrowth.

Automated Weed Management: Executes mechanical cutting of detected weeds with precision-guided rotating blades.

Soil Intelligence: Collects 7-in-1 soil data (NPK, pH, Moisture, EC, Temp) to provide farmers with optimal crop suggestions and historical reports.

Targeted Actuation: Controls automated drip irrigation and applies targeted fertilization only to plants that require it, minimizing fertilizer waste.

üöÄ Getting Started

To deploy and test the FRUTY system, you need to set up both the physical robot hardware and the cloud/mobile app infrastructure.

1. Hardware Setup (Raspberry Pi)

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YourOrg/FRUTY.git](https://github.com/YourOrg/FRUTY.git)
cd FRUTY/rpi_code


Install Dependencies:
The core code relies on the following libraries (for sensor communication, motor control, and AI inference):

# Install required packages
pip install firebase-admin numpy opencv-python gpiozero
# Install YOLOv5 dependencies (requires PyTorch)
pip install -r requirements.txt


Connect Peripherals: Ensure the 7-in-1 sensor, 3D camera, and motor drivers are correctly wired to the RPi's GPIO pins as per the /docs/hardware_schema.pdf (not included here, but a good document to add).

Configure Firebase: Download your project's Firebase Service Account JSON file and place it in the rpi_code directory as serviceAccountKey.json.

Run the Main Script:

python3 main_fruty.py


2. Mobile App Setup

The Mobile App is built using Flutter/React Native for cross-platform support.

Navigate to App Directory:

cd FRUTY/mobile_app


Install App Dependencies:

# Example for Flutter
flutter pub get


Connect to Firebase: Configure the app with the Firebase google-services.json (Android) or GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) files.

Run the App:

flutter run
